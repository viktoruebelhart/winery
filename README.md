We work at a winery and that winery began to detect some problems in the quality of the wine and grape juice produced. Therefore, a professional person in the field of agronomy began taking photos of the vine leaves and identified three different problems with the leaves.

Because of this, it was determined that it would be interesting to build something capable of quickly classifying problems in grape leaves. This would allow plants to be treated quickly and efficiently. So, let's build a convolutional neural network, which is known to perform this image classification process very efficiently.

To begin to understand this problem, let's query our data and see how this data is available to us.
